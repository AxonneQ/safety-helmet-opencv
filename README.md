# safety-helmet-opencv
4th year Image Processing project to identify whether person is wearing safety helmet on construction site or not

### Instructions:

Pre-requisites:
```
OpenCV
NumPy
cvui
easygui
matplotlib
```

1. Run `SHDetector.py` with Python 3.8
2. Click Load Image button in the UI
3. Click Safety Helmet Detection
4. Optionally Save the output to a file using Save Image button

Pseudocode:

preProcess():
* Convert to RGB, and remove the noise using `cv2.fastNlMeansDenoising`

getSkinMask():
* SkinDetector Class
* HSV color segmentation of skin values
* WaterShedding
* otsu thresholding
* return skin mask

getFaces():
* generate sorted contours from the skinMask
* discard any contour bounding rect that we deem too small by comparing its area to the largest area. If an area is â…• the size of the largest we discard it.
* We then combine all the clusters of rectangles that are touching each other.
* If a rectangle contains any children then discard them too
* If by this point we have no values from prev functions then we assume our contours correctly picked out the correct faces and reset back to these values instead.
* A face helmet will always be on the upper body in the image, therefore we discard any contours that appear under a contour.
* We now reliably have a face detection but we need to double its height upwards in order to search for the helmet as well.

getHelmets(src_img, skinMask, faces):
* convert the original image to rgb
* get a region of image (ROI) using the inverted skinMask
* get rid of all values that are below 150, above 250 ro get rid of the background
* for each face region determine whether it includes a helmet using `processHelmet(face_image)` function
* if the function returns true, draw a green rectangle around the face else draw a red one

processHelmet(face_image):
* calculate the area of the face
* find range of predetermined HSV values of the helmets (specific colours)
* if area of the helmet takes more than 39.0 % then return true else false
